# pyCrypt
 This is a respository for handy command line scripts for encrypting and decrypting data.

# Reverse Cipher
 This contains three scripts. One specifically for encrypting text with the reverse cipher, one specifically for decrypting text and one which will allow you to select which function you would like to perform inside of the script. Future script enhancements will hopefully allow you to select encryption or decryption as a command line argument and to import a text file for encryption or decryption.
